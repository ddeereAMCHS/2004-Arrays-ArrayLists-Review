## Due: Thur 9/1 at 11:59 PM

- Create a program called `ArraysReview.java`
- Prompt the user for a filename
- Read in all the values and store them in both an array and an ArrayList
- Do the following actions for both the array and the ArrayList:
  - Remove the element with value 19 if it exists
    - If it exists, print "Element with value 19 removed" and shift any subsequent elements to the left
    - If it does not exist, print "No element with value 19 found"
  - Remove the element with value 7 if it exists
    - If it exists, print "Element with value 7 removed" and shift any subsequent elements to the left
    - If it does not exist, print "No element with value 7 found"
  - Set the element at index 3 to be 9
  - Insert an element with value 12 at index 5 and shift any subsequent elements to the right
